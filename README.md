# Node.js Server: Handling Long Response Times

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js servers:  long response times leading to client-side timeouts.  The `bug.js` file shows a server that introduces a 5-second delay before responding.  This can cause problems if the client doesn't implement proper timeout handling.

The solution, found in `bugSolution.js`, addresses this issue by utilizing appropriate techniques to manage long-running operations or by setting timeouts on the server-side to prevent indefinite blocking.
